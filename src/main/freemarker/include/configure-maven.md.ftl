Configure Maven
---------------

<#if compatibility.portal.projectNameShort == "GateIn">
You do not need to touch your settings.xml because of this quickstart. All necessary artifacts are available in public
repositories.
<#else>
You have two options how you can configure Maven: A. Use hosted Maven repository or B. Download & setup zipped Maven repository.

### A. Use hosted Maven repository

This is the easier and thus recommended option. You need to configure the Maven user settings as follows:

* Look for the `settings.xml` file in the `${r"${user.home}"}/.m2/` directory. For example:

        For Linux or Mac: ~/.m2/settings.xml
        For Windows:       \Users\USER_NAME\.m2\settings.xml or \Documents and Settings\USER_NAME\.m2\settings.xml
* If you have an existing `settings.xml` file, modify it with the configuration information from the `settings-hosted-repo.xml`
  file located in the root folder of ${compatibility.portal.product.projectName} quickstarts. This effectivelly results in
  adding `http://maven.repository.redhat.com/techpreview/all` and `http://maven.repository.redhat.com/earlyaccess/all/` as `<repository>` and `<pluginRepository>` elements to your `settings.xml`.
  Note that `earlyaccess/all` is necessary only for JPP 6.1 Beta. The final version will not need it.
* If there is no `settings.xml` file, copy the `settings-hosted-repo.xml` file to the `.m2` directory for your
  operating system and rename it to `settings.xml`.

### B. Download & setup zipped Maven repositories

1.  Download the following zipped Maven repositories from [Red Hat Customer Portal](https://access.redhat.com/),
    Downloads > JBoss Enterprise Middleware:
    * ${compatibility.portal.product.projectNameAndVersion} Maven Repository
    * Web Framework Kit ${compatibility.wfk.versionMmm} Maven Repository
    * Web Framework Kit 2.2.0 Maven Repository
    * Web Framework Kit 2.1.0 Maven Repository
    * Web Framework Kit 2.0.0 Maven Repository
    * Application Platform ${compatibility.as.versionMmm} Maven Repository
    * Application Platform 6.0.1 Maven Repository
    * Application Platform 6.0.0 Maven Repository

    Unpack each of these files to a separate directory.

2.  Modify the `settings-zipped-repos.xml` file located in the root directory of ${compatibility.portal.product.projectName}
    quickstarts:
    * For each zipped repository unpacked in the previous step, replace `/path/to/repo/` within `file:///path/to/repo/...`
      with the fully qualified path of the directory where you unpacked the given zipped Maven repository in the previous
      step.
    * Note that path to each repository needs tobe set twice: one within `<repository>` tag and one within
      `<pluginRepository>` tag.
    * Be sure to use 3 forward slashes after `file:`. Two slashes are there for the protocol and one for the fully qualified
      path. For example:

            file:///home/joedoe/Quickstarts/jpp-${compatibility.portal.versionMajor}.${compatibility.portal.versionMinor}-quickstarts
3.  Configure the Maven user settings.
    * Look for the `settings.xml` file in the `${r"${user.home}"}/.m2/` directory. For example:

            For Linux or Mac: ~/.m2/settings.xml
            For Windows:       \Users\USER_NAME\.m2\settings.xml or \Documents and Settings\USER_NAME\.m2\settings.xml
    * If you have an existing `settings.xml` file, modify it with the configuration information from the `example-settings.xml`
      file.
    * If there is no `settings.xml` file, copy the modified `example-settings.xml` file to the `.m2` directory for your
      operating system and rename it to `settings.xml`.
